### SIGCSE 2026

We had a blast at SIGCSE 2026. We were involved in 4 sessions this year and loved meeting everyone by the entryway arch. Thanks to all those who stopped by at our un-booth or joined us in our sessions. We loved speaking with you all! Abstracts from our sessions along with links to our slides are below! 


#### Session 1 - Pre-Conference Full Day Workshop 
- **Title:** GitHub for Educators: A Full-Day, Hands-On Workshop for Teaching with GitHub
- **[Slides](https://github.com/github-education-resources/teacher-toolbox/blob/main/events-videos/sigcse-2026/GitHub%20101%20-%20Workshop.pdf)** 
- **Abstract**: This full-day, hands-on workshop gives educators practical, classroom-ready skills for integrating GitHub into their teaching. We”ll begin in GitHub.com with a two-hour GitHub 101 session covering account setup, repositories, collaboration essentials, an introduction to GitHub Copilot, and how to navigate GitHub’s on-demand learning resources.
In the afternoon, we'll shift to an advanced Copilot session designed specifically for teaching scenarios. From there, participants can choose among breakout tracks that align with their instructional goals or join structured work time to build lessons, course projects, or certification progress with live support from GitHub experts.
Attendees will leave with plug-and-play classroom materials, access to GitHub Learn resources, and eligibility for GitHub certification vouchers. The workshop is designed to help educators confidently introduce real-world developer tools and AI-enhanced workflows into their curriculum.


#### Session 2
- **Title:** Everything You Wanted to Know About Agentic AI (But Were Afraid to Ask)
- **[Slides](https://github.com/github-education-resources/teacher-toolbox/blob/main/events-videos/sigcse-2026/EverythingYouWantedToKnowAboutAIAgents.pdf)** 
- **Abstract:** Feeling like AI is moving faster than you can keep up? You’re not alone. With new terminology, new tools, and constant innovation, it can be hard to separate the signal from the noise. This session is designed to give educators a clear, grounded understanding of where the industry is headed.
We will break down what Agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are, why they matter, and how developers are using them in modern software development—including through new GitHub tools such as Agent HQ and Mission Control. You’ll learn how GitHub Copilot has evolved beyond autocomplete-style suggestions into a broader ecosystem of agents and extensible workflows that help developers design, debug, and ship software more efficiently.
Through live demonstrations, we’ll show how agents can execute multi-step tasks, troubleshoot code, interpret project context, and connect with external tools or data sources. You will walk away with a clearer understanding of the latest Copilot capabilities and how these emerging patterns can support both teaching and learning. The session concludes with dedicated Q&A time to help translate concepts into practical strategies you can bring into your classroom.


#### Session 3
- **Title:** GitHub Education: Cultivating the Educator Community
- **[Slides](https://github.com/github-education-resources/teacher-toolbox/blob/main/events-videos/sigcse-2026/GitHub%20Education%20-%20Cultivating%20the%20Educator%20Community.pdf)**
- **Abstract:** GitHub Education’s mission is to bring tech and open source collaboration to students and educators across the globe. As technology, including AI, rapidly advances, computing education is racing and evolving to keep abreast of the changes. GitHub Education believes educators are key to this evolution. We will share how GitHub Education engages with and supports the educator community through products such as GitHub Classroom, programs such as the Campus Program, and our community-based initiatives. We will share the broader approach guiding this work—how our programs and tools fit together, the principles shaping their evolution, and the areas where we’re investing to better support students, teachers, and institutions. Designed as a precursor to the GitHub Educator Summit in March 2026, this session gives participants an inside look at what GitHub Education offers today, what’s new, and what’s changing in the months ahead.

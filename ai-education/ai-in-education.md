# AI in Education

 [Microsoft Elevate for Educators](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/2026/01/introducing-microsoft-innovations-and-programs-to-support-ai-powered-teaching-and-learning/) is a program connecting educators with community, professional development, and AI tools to transform teaching.
 
 Another excellent resource for getting started with AI in your classroom is using TeachAI's [AI Guidance for Schools Toolkit.](https://www.teachai.org/toolkit)
